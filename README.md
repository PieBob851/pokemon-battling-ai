# Pokémon Battling AI

This project is an AI designed to battle in Pokémon Showdown, the popular online Pokémon battle simulator. The AI is developed in Python and uses Pokémon Showdown, running in TypeScript, to simulate battles and refine its strategies.

## Project Status

This project is in the early stages of development. So far, only the communication between Python (for the AI) and TypeScript (running the Pokémon Showdown simulator) has been set up. Future updates will focus on improving the AI’s decision-making and battle strategies.

## Setup

Before running the project, ensure all necessary Node.js packages are installed with npm install.
Please ensure Node.js is a recent enough version to run Showdown (should be compatible with 16+, but newer version should be safer)
